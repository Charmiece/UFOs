# UFOs

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to create a sight that cold filter through UFO sightings based on date, city and state, and shape.

## Results
Once the webpage is active, the user will see an informative blurb and the complete list of data.

On the bottom left of the screen, there is an area where the user can begin to filter through the data.

Once the user begins filtering through the data, the list will shorten until the target was reached or there was no sightings listed for that location.

##Summary

One drawback of this webpage is the filtering. The user would have to use exact spelling and also know where to filter to in order to get results. one way to solve both of those issues would be to provide a drop down menu option. This would help with spelling options if one of the feature of the drop down wea autofill or not give an option to type. Another helpful thing would be a way to easily refresh the filter. Having to go into each cell and delete can be tedious.
